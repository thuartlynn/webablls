                <p class="ml-4"><strong>The ABLLS-R&#174; assessment is the assessment within WebABLLS</strong><p>
                <p class="ml-4">Developed by Dr. Partington, the ABLLS-R system is an assessment tool, curriculum guide, and skills-tracking system used to help guide the instruction of language and critical learner skills for children with autism or other developmental disabilities. This practical and parent-friendly tool can be used to facilitate the identification of skills needed by your child to communicate effectively and learn from everyday experiences. <p>

                <p class="ml-4">The ABLLS-R provides a comprehensive review of 544 skills from 25 skill areas including language, social interaction, self-help, academic, and motor skills that most typically developing children acquire prior to entering kindergarten. The task items within each skill area are arranged from simpler to more complex tasks. Expressive language skills are assessed based upon the behavioral analysis of language as presented by Dr. B.F. Skinner in his book, Verbal Behavior (1957).<p>

                <p class="ml-4">The assessment results allow parents and professionals to pinpoint obstacles that have been preventing a child from acquiring new skills and to develop a comprehensive, highly personalized, language-based curriculum.<p>

                <p class="ml-4">The ABLLS was upadted in 2006 to include more task items and provide a more specific sequence in the developmental order of items within the various skill areas. Significant changes were made in the revised version of the vocal imitation section with input from Denise Senick-Pirri, SLP-CCC. Additional improvements were made to incorporate items associated with social interaction skills, motor imitation, and other joint-attention skills, and to ensure the fluent use of established skills.<p>

                <p class="ml-4">The print version of  ABLLS-R is comprised of two manuals:<br>
                <a href="{{ url('/SupportCenter/about-ablls-r/the-ablls-r-protocol') }}">The ABLLS-R Protocol</a></br>
