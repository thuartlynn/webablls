                <p class="ml-4">The share student page allows you to link share permissions to a student profile with other WebABLLS users. Granting "Owner Rights" to another user is only possible for the owner right holders. Caution: When "Owner Rights" are granted to another user, you both have equal permissions to a student profile, and your owner rights can be withdrawn by another owner.</p>
                <p class="ml-4">Additional sharing options available include setting the Full Access, which includes modify rights to all shared functions (either with or without the ability to link share permissions to others), as well as more restricted sharing options such as linking view or modify permissions specifically for Basic Info, Assessments and Reports, Files, and/or Analytics.</p>
                <p class="ml-4">The users listed on the screen are all users registered to your organization as well as users added by you as contacts. If you wish to share a student profile with a user not listed below, add the user as a new contact using the Add Contact section below or through the Contacts tab – if the user exists in the WebABLLS system, the Contact will be added to your Personal Contacts’ list. If there is no match in the system for the email address entered, a user account will need to be created.</p>
