                <p class="ml-4"><strong>Action panels</strong> are found on nearly every screen throughout WebABLLS. They are light blue boxes of various sizes with links to features and functions related to the current screen. The titles within the action panels will vary depending on the group of links related to a particular action panel.</p>
                <p class="ml-4"><strong>Action panels links can be active or inactive...</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On the Student List, Assessment List, All Reports' and Analytics List screens, the links are inactive until a student, assessment, report, or analysis is selected</li>
                    <li>Some links may be inactive due the permissions authorized between a student profile and a user account</li>
                    <li>Here is an example an <strong>Action Panel</strong> on the <strong>Student List</strong> screen:</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="ml-4">As you can see from the image above, most links are inactive except for Add Student. When a link is inactive, the action is not available because WebABLLS needs a student to be designated. Select (or highlight) the row that corresponds with the student with whom you are working. This tells WebABLLS which student profile to display with the action selected.</p>

                <p class="ml-4">Once a student has been selected, the links within the action panel become active</p>
